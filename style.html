    <h1 class="hello">Reason why minecraft sucks right now</h1>
    <div class="hello">
        <p>
            The reason minecraft sucks is because of this kayden kid. He keeps on queiting on every world we make and every time we make a world he is like of ima just turn chests on just to tp and we use
            it for other stuff than tp which then we quiet the world. The real real reason is because minecraft is a very limited game becuase it doesn't take that long to beeat the game and all you have 
            left to do is build and build farms. So minecraft needs to gett better updates and they should more often lissen to the people that play minecraft. 
        </p>
        A thing that minecraft devs should add is shaders that don't explode your pc and like shaders and a texture pack that make it look more real and more relaxing. They should also add more updates that
        are like not dumb like the minecraft devs barly lissen to the people that play minecaft 24/7 and they should really lissen to them more often. They also need to stop adding like uneeded blocks
        and they should add more serect updates that you have to find yourself and they will not list is there is a update or not and they will also list nothing about the upadte. They should also addd hairobrine
        because why not it would be a really good thing if they did.
